Teaching Students How to Use Geant4

Hello everyone! I learned Geant4 myself when I was a senior. Well it took me about half a year to be familiar everything. Recently I got a new job to teach sophomores how to use Geant4 for high-energy experiment simulations. It's a good chance to manage all the materials I got. I hope my effort can reduce twists and turns for my students and other people. All the document in this repository will be both written in Chinese, my native language, and English to help more people.

大噶好！我在大四的时候花了半年摸索出Geant4的用法。最近我多了份新工作——教同学使用Geant4模拟高能物理实验。这里我把我的教学材料记录下来，希望可以帮助大家少踩坑。

Guide 教程: http://geant4.slac.stanford.edu/SLACTutorial14/Agenda.html

Personally, I think this is the best Geant4 guide on the Internet, which is created by Stanford SLAC for a summer training program. I was helped a lot by it.

我个人认为这是网上能找到的最好的Geant4教程，来自斯坦福SLAC实验室的一个暑期学校。这个教程帮了我很多。
